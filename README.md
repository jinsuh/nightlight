# nightlight
Inspired by http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-Night-Light/. The nightlight contains a Raspberry Pi with a nodejs server. The phone application connects to the server to control the light.

The nodejs and Android parts have been divided into two different folders.

<b>Node.js</b>  
To run the server:
node server.js
